I'll start saying that there is two levels of Tensorflow. The normal one where we have to set up placeholders, variables and sessions to train and test and the high-level one.
I was working with the first one most of the time for sequence classification. Then, I moved to Time Series prediction (or regression) and I couldn't find examples  that weren't using the second level (that seems mucho more to scikit Fit and Evaluate functions).
