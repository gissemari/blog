title: "Receiving results from AAAI-19"

This year the scores ranges from 1 to 10 where 1 is trivial and 10 is accepted (and within the top 5%). The reviews of 3 different people were published on Friday night and we have a rebuttal period of 4 days. Each of them point out interesting issues/questions that as an author you should reply. Then, you submited and a final result is given to you. For AAAI19 this was done by November 4th.
They also send several instructions to send the camera-ready document such as styles, spaces, images quality.

After some time, you are asked to upload your tex file. For this, I had some doubts about the instructions. For instance:
- PDFs that embed type 3 fonts. I verified them by
- includegraphics
