I'll start saying that there is two levels of Tensorflow. The normal one where we have to set up placeholders, variables and sessions to train and test and the high-level one.
I was working with the first one most of the time for sequence classification. Then, I moved to Time Series prediction (or regression) and I couldn't find examples  that weren't using the second level (that seems mucho more to scikit Fit and Evaluate functions).
The question is also how to more parameters to the model (say batch size). It just receives 'features' and 'targets' as specified in this Yuan Tang's blog [here](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/2016/06/09/scikit-flow-v09/).
